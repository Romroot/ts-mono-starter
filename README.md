## Typescript monorepo starter (React | Eslint| Optional Chaining)

I would like to go back in the past and find this repository, but since I have already spent time I want to save your time on setting up a monorepo with a Typescript
## Why you should use

There is `0` typescript monorepo that has all in one place:
- Latest version of `Typescript` with `Lerna`
- Correctly configured `Eslint` instead deprecated Tslint
- `Optional chaining` (just shipped in ts `3.7`)
- `Stylelint` (with styled-components as an example)
- `Prettier` configured to work correctly with eslint 
- Latest `Storybook` with Typescript types display + [freshest way to describe your user stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/)
- `Husky` + `Lint-staged`
- `Babel 7`


## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Romroot/ts-monorepo-starter.git
